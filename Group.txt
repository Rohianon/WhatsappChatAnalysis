03/12/2020, 1:43 pm - +254 777 473495: While I support the petition to stop the ongoing Bill on count of not sufficient public participation in its authoring, we honestly also need to have a discussion on some best practices in the industry. For instance how do I as a professional complete with another professional charging for  example web development 3k for a *dynamic website* or 10k for an *app development*?
In inasmuch as the bill would stifle innovativenes, it somewhat if structured well would appreciate and guide good practices and accountability.

19/12/2020, 2:09 pm - +254 721 201220: Whatsapp Group Rules:

Always keep to the purpose of the group, don’t share irrelevant messages about other topics.
Don’t spam the group.
Don’t be offended if others leave.
Do politely excuse yourself before you leave a group.
Post your message in one single chunk of text, don’t post every word or sentence in a new message.
Try not to have long one-on-one conversations in the group. Switch to private messages.
Do not post in the group between 22:00 and 07:00 unless it is an emergency. By emergency, we mean the “fire, floods, and broken bones” type of emergency, not the “I needed a scone recipe at 2 am because I had the munchies” type of emergency.
If a message asks for a positive response like an RSVP, don’t reply in the negative. Only say if you are able to attend. Don’t double RSVP if a second call to action is sent out for the same event.
If someone asks a question and you don’t know the answer don’t respond with “I don’t know”. Just wait for someone who knows the answer to reply.
Please don’t send in a hundred “thank you” messages. If you feel gratitude towards someone – tell them in a private message.
If someone asks a question of a personal nature (like asking for advice) don’t respond if someone else has already answered, or else respond to the person directly in a private message.
The group is not a political platform (unless you have specifically set it up for this purpose) No arguing, no heated opinions, no fear-mongering, no hyped-up drama, no fake news. Check your sources before you share.
Never EVER use a group to berate someone else or air grievances. If you have an issue address it one on one with the relevant person.
Don’t send data-insensitive messages. No-one wants their last 3GB used up on uninvited memes.
 
If you are not sure, ask yourself these three questions before you post:

Is this relevant?
Is this necessary?
Is this a good time to post?
19/12/2020, 2:09 pm - +254 713 595713: Very important. Very informative

06/01/2021, 9:39 pm - +254 721 201220: Whatsapp Group Rules:

Always keep to the purpose of the group, don’t share irrelevant messages about other topics.
Don’t spam the group.
Don’t be offended if others leave.
Do politely excuse yourself before you leave a group.
Post your message in one single chunk of text, don’t post every word or sentence in a new message.
Try not to have long one-on-one conversations in the group. Switch to private messages.
Do not post in the group between 22:00 and 07:00 unless it is an emergency. By emergency, we mean the “fire, floods, and broken bones” type of emergency, not the “I needed a scone recipe at 2 am because I had the munchies” type of emergency.
If a message asks for a positive response like an RSVP, don’t reply in the negative. Only say if you are able to attend. Don’t double RSVP if a second call to action is sent out for the same event.
If someone asks a question and you don’t know the answer don’t respond with “I don’t know”. Just wait for someone who knows the answer to reply.
Please don’t send in a hundred “thank you” messages. If you feel gratitude towards someone – tell them in a private message.
If someone asks a question of a personal nature (like asking for advice) don’t respond if someone else has already answered, or else respond to the person directly in a private message.
The group is not a political platform (unless you have specifically set it up for this purpose) No arguing, no heated opinions, no fear-mongering, no hyped-up drama, no fake news. Check your sources before you share.
Never EVER use a group to berate someone else or air grievances. If you have an issue address it one on one with the relevant person.
Don’t send data-insensitive messages. No-one wants their last 3GB used up on uninvited memes.
 
If you are not sure, ask yourself these three questions before you post:

Is this relevant?
Is this necessary?
Is this a good time to post?

Ordering a Pizza in 2022

CALLER:
    Is this Pizza Hut?
 
GOOGLE:    
No sir, it's Google Pizza.
 
CALLER:  
I must have dialed a wrong number, sorry.
 
GOOGLE:  
No sir, Google bought Pizza Hut last month.
 
CALLER:  
OK. I would like to order a pizza.
 
GOOGLE:  
Do you want your usual, sir?
 
CALLER:
My usual? You know me?
 
GOOGLE:
According to our caller ID data sheet, the last 12 times you called you ordered an extra-large pizza with three cheeses, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and meatballs on a thick crust.
 
CALLER:  
Super! That’s what I’ll have.
 
GOOGLE:
May I suggest that this time you order a pizza with ricotta, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes and olives on a whole wheat gluten-free thin crust?
 
CALLER:  
What? I don’t want a vegetarian pizza!
 
GOOGLE:  
Your cholesterol is not good, sir.
 
CALLER:  
How the hell do you know that?
 
GOOGLE:
Well, we cross-referenced your home phone number with your medical records. We have the result of your blood tests for the last 7 years.
 
CALLER:
Okay, but I do not want your rotten vegetarian pizza!  I already take medication for my cholesterol.
 
GOOGLE:
Excuse me sir, but you have not taken your medication regularly.  According to our database, you purchased only a box of 30 cholesterol tablets once at Lloyds Pharmacy, 4 months ago.
 
CALLER:  
I bought more from another Pharmacy.
 
GOOGLE:  
That doesn’t show on your credit card statement.
 
CALLER: 
I paid in cash.
 
GOOGLE:  
But you did not withdraw enough cash according to your bank statement.
 
CALLER:  
I have other sources of cash.
 
GOOGLE:
That doesn’t show on your latest tax returns, unless you bought them using an undeclared income source, which is against the law!
 
CALLER:    
WHAT THE HELL!
 
GOOGLE:  
I'm sorry sir, we use such information only with the sole intention of helping you.
 
CALLER:  
Enough already!  I'm sick to death of Google, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and all the others.  I'm going to an island without the internet, TV, where there is no phone service and no one to watch me or spy on me.
 
GOOGLE:      
I understand sir, but you need to renew your passport first. It expired 6 weeks ago...

-------------
PSA: Questions about WhatsApp?

After responding to a few hundred relatives and friends, figured it might be easier to broadcast responses to these frequently asked questions about the WhatsApp policy changes here.

Short version: your personal conversations remain personal and encrypted. WhatsApp’s data sharing hasn’t really changed, its security hasn’t changed, it remains the largest end-to-end encrypted platform available.

Long version:
Keeping aside any jokes on what valuable or secret data you are really trying to protect...

1. WhatsApp is still end to end encrypted, which means that ALL your chat threads (group or 1:1) as well as your voice/video calls are entirely secure and only available to you and the people you are talking to. Yes, that includes all your naughty content too.

2. Your contact list on the phone that you use for looking up contacts and sending messages to/calling people, is not shared with anyone, including Facebook.

3. The only time you have to worry about your data “leaking” is when you backup your WhatsApp messages to iCloud (if you are on iPhone) or equivalent Android backup service. To be able to restore that data on a new device, the backup file is not encrypted. So please protect your iCloud backups well.

4. So what are the real changes? **In future** IF and WHEN you start using WhatsApp to send messages to businesses or do payment transactions, the shopping data can be shared  with merchants and Facebook to improve their services (example making your Ads more personalized for you). When in future will this happen? Your guess is as good as mine...

5. If nothing really has changed, why all this noise? Or a more candid version of this - why can’t WhatsApp explain this in simple language? WhatsApp over-communicates and proactively shares even the slightest change that might impact its extremely high standards on privacy to run an end to end encrypted private messaging service for 2 Billion people. Good learning for us that technically nuanced and accurate messaging doesn’t work at 2B people scale.

6. Can you give feedback to the WhatsApp team about this? Absolutely. See a more detailed response from the head of WhatsApp: https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660768225841152...

7. Do I need to pay for a private/secure version of WhatsApp? Heck no. Please don’t fall for any such scams. There is only one secure, private version of WhatsApp and that is FREE for all the 2 billion people who use it. If you still feel like spending money, I’ll send you my Venmo account to transfer money to.

8. Can I stop freaking out now? Yes please and I’d like to go back and sleep as well. 

And yes, feel free to forward this to your friends and family. I won’t charge any fees nor send your data to Facebook 😉

However, what is ethical can be subjective at some point. I mean, there are obvious ethical issues, while some will really depend...

Customers definitely prefer the EASE that comes with analytics, be it targeted ads, home deliveries, customised services/goods etc. 

BUT they seem to have issues when their data is used. 

PIIs  debate is overrated.

20/01/2021, 1:30 pm - +254 715 193822: I think the worry is more on how the data collected is going to be used, having in mind Facebook have a bad reputation on how they use the data.
20/01/2021, 1:31 pm - +254 715 366297: Imagine even branch and tala have a similar bad reputation

20/01/2021, 1:33 pm - +254 715 193822: Though it will have also the positive side of it
20/01/2021, 1:33 pm - +254 715 366297: One thing am sure about is that collectin data is key for companies coz that way they are able to refine their offersand ensure they keep giving value.
20/01/2021, 1:33 pm - +254 715 366297: The line they need to draw is the ethical bit and ensuring data is not used for harm
20/01/2021, 1:33 pm - +254 725 842658: True, even central bank is at a point to check (decide on this or the regulation bit if the same)
20/01/2021, 1:34 pm - +254 715 366297: The debate should therefore be on  data ethics rather than am not going to give them my data.

Helloo!!

I'm requesting you all to please limit movement out of the house unless extremely important. 
Try and use mpesa where possible for payment and reduce use of notes. 
The new strain of covid is here and it's not looking good for us. 
Three weeks ago the hospital was empty and now we are full. The amount of people we have admitted in the last three to four nights is crazy! 
Aga Khan and Nairobi Hospital is full with patients from Tanzania as well.

This is affecting both old and young. There is a 1 month old baby who has covid as well! 

*Please take it seriously*

10/05/2021, 9:58 am - +254 723 799100: At first glance I can see a huge demand for people to invest in Excel and SQL apart from having skills in Python and such related frameworks resourceful for building a Data Career. I've observed this even with my new entry into Data Science, am engaged in some scholarship and I see the first investment being advocated is to learn SQL. 
Can I reason that if you've entered the data field you'll tend to be working on systems rather than what we know Data Science is for? Collection of Data and such? Any thoughts on it?
10/05/2021, 10:21 am - +254 726 354929: My thoughts - I would disagree that data science is about collection of data at all..

 Data science is about generating insights from data which would imply the data is already collected.. It may require consolidation, restructuring, clean-up but it must already exist somewhere.

23/05/2021, 7:02 pm - +254 721 201220: Vetting numbers before re-opening for posting. Bare with us
23/05/2021, 9:54 pm - +254 721 201220: Whatsapp Group Rules:

Always keep to the purpose of the group, don’t share irrelevant messages about other topics.
Don’t spam the group.
Don’t be offended if others leave.
Do politely excuse yourself before you leave a group.
Post your message in one single chunk of text, don’t post every word or sentence in a new message.
Try not to have long one-on-one conversations in the group. Switch to private messages.
Do not post in the group between 22:00 and 07:00 unless it is an emergency. By emergency, we mean the “fire, floods, and broken bones” type of emergency, not the “I needed a scone recipe at 2 am because I had the munchies” type of emergency.
If a message asks for a positive response like an RSVP, don’t reply in the negative. Only say if you are able to attend. Don’t double RSVP if a second call to action is sent out for the same event.
If someone asks a question and you don’t know the answer don’t respond with “I don’t know”. Just wait for someone who knows the answer to reply.
Please don’t send in a hundred “thank you” messages. If you feel gratitude towards someone – tell them in a private message.
If someone asks a question of a personal nature (like asking for advice) don’t respond if someone else has already answered, or else respond to the person directly in a private message.
The group is not a political platform (unless you have specifically set it up for this purpose) No arguing, no heated opinions, no fear-mongering, no hyped-up drama, no fake news. Check your sources before you share.
Never EVER use a group to berate someone else or air grievances. If you have an issue address it one on one with the relevant person.
Don’t send data-insensitive messages. No-one wants their last 3GB used up on uninvited memes.
 
If you are not sure, ask yourself these three questions before you post:

Is this relevant?
Is this necessary?
Is this a good time to post?
23/05/2021, 9:55 pm - +254 721 201220: Group will be reopen tomorrow morning. Thanks for your patience

28/05/2021, 7:57 am - +254 729 237218: Hi guys,

I hope you're well. 

I host a domain name with Safaricom and it has a DB. I'd like to connect Power BI to that DB so I can visualise data in real-time since data is also input into the DB in real-time. 

I have tried connecting to it directly but I keep on getting login error. So for now, I resort to manually downloading the DB into Excel then connecting it to Power BI.

Any one here ever tried doing a similar thing and succeeded? How did you do it?

Thanks in advance 🙏
28/05/2021, 7:59 am - +254 700 826485: Check if the Db allows for external connections, if not you May need to whitelist your power bi ip
28/05/2021, 8:00 am - +254 700 826485: Also a general encouraged pattern, don't do BI on your production db
28/05/2021, 8:07 am - +254 729 237218: Thanks @254700826485, I'll check on and implement the above suggestions where necessary. Thanks so much 🙏

28/05/2021, 12:25 pm - +254 729 237218: Yes I could however,  for this particular task, it's purely on Power BI. 

Thanks for the suggestion.

12/06/2021, 9:22 am - +254 727 604444: The OECD and its OECD.AI Network of Experts, in which I participate, has launched a public consultation on a draft Framework for Classifying AI systems that is part of the OECD Programme on AI and Work, Innovation, Productivity and Skills (AI-WIPS) supported by the German Labour Ministry.

 

We are seeking input to improve the framework so it is useful and technically robust and would like to solicit your feedback as your work is related.

 

The framework is a user-friendly tool to help policy makers and others differentiate between different types of AI systems and their different impacts on policy goals along 4 dimensions: 1) context; 2) data and input; 3) AI model; and 4) task and output. It aims to provide a common baseline of the key characteristics of AI systems that can impact trustworthy AI; to inform initiatives from impact assessment to regulation and self-regulation.



 

The deadline for input is 30 June 2021.  Please take 5 minutes to test the Framework on a real AI system or, if you have a little more time, comment on the report on https://www.oecd.ai/classification.

 

We would much appreciate your input and look forward to hearing from you. For more information or any queries, please reach out to ai@oecd.org.

Out of curiosity, is there a way to integrate data collection forms from say google forms, monkey survey or microsoft forms directly to analysis tools such as SPSS? (thnking APIs or close technology???? )

I am aware about the text export import way but looking towards automation. 
Assitance / advice appreciated.

07/07/2021, 11:29 am - Billy Otieno Oracle: Hi Mike,

First, have a look into the API for each of the data collection forms providers:

For example the API's:
https://developer.surveymonkey.com/
https://developers.google.com/sheets/api
Microsoft Forms API - I am not sure if there's one already.

You'll then need to develop a custom solution that does the integration of the three providers and expose data to SPSS. It would be great if there was an off-the-shelf solution that does the integration (not sure if there's one) but on this, I would recommend a custom build given you are looking for automation per your use case.

From a business perspective, an alternative would be to stick to one form provider to make things a bit easier (that is if one form provider can cater to your survey needs), then automate. If by any chance it fits your needs.
07/07/2021, 11:36 am - +254 725 842658: Thanks Sir Billy, I think developing for specific usecase can be expensive in the longeun but will research on how this can be generalized as a packege development for re-use.

I know how tough it can get to keep seitching between multiple groups to organise/streamline comms (thanks to the limitation on WhatsApp platform) How about moving this to telegram?

Thanks a lot for this suggestion. We have created a telegram group, you can have access to it here: https://t.me/joinchat/GrwvT67CYuFiMWNk (Please do join). For those of us who still prefer WhatsApp, we will still be managing our communication across both platforms, to accommodate diverse needs. We however would like all of us to also join in on telegram, which gives us the breadth of collaboration as we are able to consolidate all the groups into one based on the extended group numbers that telegram provides. 

Mahalo! Billy

I am working on a listing for institutions operating locally (East Africa) and offering data science/analytics/data engineeering courses, this is due to a number of request I have recieved asking for places where one could learn say the fundamentals or core data science skills in Kenya and get certified for it.

I am requesting for anyone who would wish to collaborate with me to populate and validate this list so that we could share it as a resource to the entire community. So far, I have captured (4) institutions that I am aware off, they could be lots of them and thats why I am enlisting for collaboration. 

We generally looking for institutions offering certification programs and/or full courses and creating repo where anyone who would like to get into data science & analytics can find or link from.

Below I have shared an interim doc, with listing of 4 institutions. Thank you.

17/08/2021, 1:20 pm - +254 729 032921: Do we have APIs for automating data access in Kenya?
17/08/2021, 1:32 pm - +254 729 032921: During the release of national exams, there are usually USSD codes that are used to fetch results. How do companies like Safaricom access the KNEC data?

17/08/2021, 4:44 pm - Billy Otieno Oracle: I am not really sure about this. But I know KNEC have a portal they call QMIS, that covers registration, access to results and also requesting of results slip etc. They could be providing API access to Safaricom and the like during results release for students to access their results via simple SMS/USSD requests.
17/08/2021, 5:40 pm - +254 700 335924: Many years ago I built this system and we would obtain a file from KNEC that we would load up in the database from which our query engine would return the results via the SMS

18/08/2021, 7:44 pm - Billy Otieno Oracle: Hey guys,

I need some help.
I’m part of a team at Mozilla working on a dataset for Kiswahili Speech Recognition. We are looking to build a dataset useful in general contexts as well as subsets of this dataset that can be useful in the agricultural and finance domains. As part of the use case specific work, we’re looking to identify partners working in these sectors who would be willing to give us insight into how they might use the dataset and/or the speech recognition models once they’re trained. 

Our intention at this point is to make sure we are investing time in tools that people out there will use and are looking to identify partners that we can pilot with. Then once the dataset and models are available, Mozilla will have grants for start-ups in EA who’ll be piloting work with the resources. 

We currently have 2 forms that you can fill, either as an individual(https://forms.gle/xqtWDFaZzEhow6xSA) or as part of a stakeholders group(https://forms.gle/3TPYRfET2c9u7P236).

If you fit the profile, please help us out by sharing your views. 
Feel free to also either share this message with individuals/organisations who do fit the profile of point me in their direction via DM.

Thanksies!
:)

15/09/2021, 12:20 pm - Billy Otieno Oracle: *AI Regulation & What it means for Businesses*

In May, the European Union became the first governmental body in the world to issue a comprehensive response in the form of draft regulations aimed specifically at the development and use of AI. The proposed regulations would apply to any AI system used or providing outputs within the European Union, signaling implications for organizations around the world.

Although the EU regulation is not yet in force, it provides clear insight into the future of AI regulation as a whole. 

What doe's this mean for the future of AI Regulation?
What impacts will this have on business?

Paronychia. 

This is a skin infection that develops around the nail. It occurs when bacteria or fungi get under the skin. Sometimes it could be because of cuts around the nails as a result of biting or pulling the nail cuticles.

This leads to inflammations around the nails and may pluck the affected nail out.

I have been dealing with this for a while, using antibiotic drugs and hospitals to draw out the fluids from the nails.

Gues what, I recently learnt how to deal with this in a simple way at home ❤️.

1. When I applied activated charcoal alone around the affected area, it took less than 24 hours to gather all the dirty fluid and it bursts on its own.

2. When I mixed the activated charcoal and Olive oil, the infection went all away and the nail recoved completely.

You can try this the next you or someone around you is infected and see how it goes 😁.

Meanwhile, avoid exposing your finger and toe nails to cuts and chemicals in always.

Jesus Healed the Sick while He was on earth, we can cooperate with Him to propagate good health amongst His Children. 


Stay Healthy in Christ 🍇.
